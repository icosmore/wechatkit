##python toolkit to interactive with Wechat web interfaces.##

This project initially is based on https://github.com/0x5e/wechat-deleted-friends, some efforts are taken to make the code more OOP and readable.
Logining and processing are treated as independent procedures.   

Additional features will be added recently, please keep watch.

For Windows user, execute *run.bat*.
For Linux/OSX user, execute *run.sh*.

3 steps are taken:
*  ./WechatKit.py test login
